# Data_Science_A-Z---Udemy
A course purchased from and taken on Udemy for Data Science.

I am taking this to help further build real-world skills in data science. This repository is not meant as a substitute to the class. It is meant to show what skills I have learned from this class and what skills have been gained as a result. This course has four parts: Visualization with Tableau, Modeling, Data Preparation, and Communication. I am taking these in this order:

Data Preparation -> Visualization -> Modeling -> Communication

(Sections) 16-23 ->      3-6      ->    7-15   ->     24-26

As of now I have completed sections 1-2, 16-20.  Learned factors up to this point: Visual Basic, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)

Homework Sections are marked with HW. These will typically include a writeup from me to cover items that would be hard to get working just from the files, such as Visual Studio projects. Items bigger than the allowed 25mb are zipped instead of just left alone. Note that there are other folders in the original folders for organization purposes, however, GitHub does not show those.
