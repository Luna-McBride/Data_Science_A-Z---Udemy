# Data_Science_A-Z---Udemy
A course purchased from and taken on Udemy for Data Science.

I took part of this to help further build real-world skills in data science. I decided to only do the visualization and data preparation portions, as the modeling portion would have been review. I know review would have been helpful, but the instructor was going to do it outside of a typical programming language. This would have been more helpful if it were in a programming language like Python or R. 

This repository is not meant as a substitute to the class. It is meant to show what skills I have learned from this class and what skills have been gained as a result. This course has four parts: Visualization with Tableau, Modeling, Data Preparation, and Communication.This is the order I intended to do the class:

Data Preparation -> Visualization -> Modeling -> Communication

(Sections) 16-23 ->      3-6      ->    7-15   ->     24-26

I completed sections 1-6, 16-23.  Learned factors: Visual Basic, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Prcedures, ETL, Tableau, Chi-Squared testing via Excel.

Homework Sections are marked with HW. These will typically include a writeup from me to cover items that would be hard to get working just from the files, such as Visual Studio projects. Items bigger than the allowed 25mb are zipped instead of just left alone. Note that there are other folders in the original folders for organization purposes, however, GitHub does not show those.
